                <p>
                    Goku is the main protagonist and hero of the Dragon Ball manga series and animated television series created by Akira Toriyama. He is one of the survivors of the extinct Saiyan race. He was sent as a baby to planet Earth in order to destroy it. When he arrived he was a violent kid, due to his warrior nature.Goku is pure of heart, possessing no negative feelings or thoughts. He is highly loyal to his friends and family and is extremely protective of them as a result. He loves them very much that he is willing to sacrifice himself to save others as he did against Raditz and Cell.What makes Goku a hero is that he often shows kindness to all big and small, weak and powerful, deserving and undeserving. Unlike most Saiyans (and thanks to being dropped on his head as a kid), Goku possessed the desire for power but none of the hostility that came with it.
